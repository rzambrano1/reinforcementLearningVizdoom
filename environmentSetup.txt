Step 1: Install Linux Subsystem in Windows

This step follows this guide:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

From Windows PowerShell run the following command

wsl --install

This step is important because VizDoom as well as other RL libraries (such as Open AI's Spinning Up) 
run either on Mac OS or Ubuntu.

Step 2: Install Tensor Flow on WSL

This step follows this tutorial
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux

It creates a conda environment to run TensorFlow with GPU

Previously I was running a virtual environment using venv. See details at:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

Step 3: To run tests we need to run the Jupyter notebooks from WSL

Here there is a guide to run Jupyter Notebooks from WSL
https://harshityadav95.medium.com/jupyter-notebook-in-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-8b46fdf0a536

The basic idea is to instal jupyter in the virtual environment from WSL
pip3 install jupyter

Then change bash configuration from VIM by running:
vim ~/.bashrc

And then adding the following line at the end:
alias jupyter-notebook="~/.local/bin/jupyter-notebook --no-browser"

Finally, after running the command $jupyter notebook from WSL one has to go to a web browser and 
either follow the links offered in the command line or go to the following url: localhost:8888

Final Notes:

===== 1 =====

Here there is a workaroud to run Spinning Up from the WSL
https://github.com/openai/spinningup/issues/23

===== 2 =====

There was an error:

libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to open swrast: /usr/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory (search paths /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri:\$${ORIGIN}/dri:/usr/lib/dri, suffix _dri)
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast

I solved by following this troubleshoot:
https://github.com/openai/spinningup/issues/377

===== 3 =====

Install the following packages:

https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm#installation
https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/user_guide/install.html

Jupyter:
pip3 install jupyter

ViZDoom:
sudp apt install cmake git libboost-all-dev libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev
pip install vizdoom

MatPlotLib:
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
